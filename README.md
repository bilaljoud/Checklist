# Checklist

This is a checklist web app created entirely by me, without following any kind of guide. I see it as a sort of playground where i can add features and test things that I learn through tutorials and such, a way for me to apply what I learn to a situation and project that may be different to that of an online guide's
This is a project that grows with the developer. 

Why a checklist? I've always liked being productive, but I sometimes tend to get off track a bit, so this project has the dual purpose of improving myself as a developer, and as a tool that has value to me and is something good enough that I would legitamately use it daily
